# Mixture-of-Experts Language Model Architecture Report

## 1. Architecture Overview

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Language Model implements a transformer-based architecture with sparse expert routing. 
Each token is processed by a subset of available experts, allowing for specialization and efficient scaling.

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Expert Routing

The router determines which experts should process each token based on the token's features. 
The routing mechanism includes:
- Top-k selection of experts for each token
- Load balancing to prevent expert overutilization
- Capacity factors to handle varying batch sizes
- Expert pruning to eliminate unused experts

### Performance Optimizations

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:
- Vectorized token processing
- Expert-parallel processing
- Memory-efficient attention
- Gradient checkpointing option
- Specialized experts for different domains
